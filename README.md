# IThinkJasonShouldHaveBeenOnS-U-I-C-I-D-EWatchSinceFeb2017IThinkHesBeenWanting2TakeEveryoneOutWithHim

i dont think theres anything wrong with saying it as i see it, as ive seen it

i think this truly and accurately describes the violence that hes imposed on others including myself 

i dont think he thinks very highly of himself, i think he has serious self-confidence issues and i believe he really doesnt have a lot to live for

(fking weird tho, i will say that ... its not funny, but it is kind of funny im trying not to laugh the more i think about it ðŸ¤­ this man's life sounds so pathetic)

im still trying not to laugh at this, i know its really sad and serious but still i cant help myself

think of the life he got to look forward to ... that he's living now ... the one where he edits his own wikipedia page (and the edits are related to me and you) and follows random people on twitter/bluesky so they follow him to bring up his loser follower count rotfl, what a life, what a complete whacko, what a complete fking loser

when i looked at his bluesky earlier, it clearly looks like hes in some mental decline ... __he also must shower like once a week__ ðŸ˜‚ -- weird stuff, weird whats out there, and i should add emphasis to the fact that i dont know him, i talked to him like twice and thats it, weird weird weird
