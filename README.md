i dont think theres anything wrong with saying it as i see it, as ive seen it

i think this truly and accurately describes the violence that hes imposed on others including myself 

i dont think he thinks very highly of himself, i think he has serious self-confidence issues and i believe he really doesnt have a lot to live for

(fking weird tho, i will say that ... its not funny, but it is kind of funny im trying not to laugh the more i think about it ðŸ¤­ this man's life sounds so pathetic)

im still trying not to laugh at this, i know its really sad and serious but still i cant help myself
